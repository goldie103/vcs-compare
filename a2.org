* Data
The data used was the public repositories on [[http://github.com][Github]] and [[http://bitbucket.org][Bitbucket]], and was obtained by querying their respective APIs.

Both APIs produced a JSON-formatted result, which in some cases directly included the required data, or included a link to another API query which held related data. In some form or another, both had access to all of the following:
    - Name
    - Description
    - Owner
    - Size
    - Language
    - Branches
    - Commits
    - Issues
    - Forks
    - Subscribers

Of this, only these were used and saved into the database:
    - Name
    - Description
    - Size
    - Number of forks
    - Primary language

As well as an added ~host~ key for which host the data came from (i.e. ~GH~ for Github or ~BB~ for Bitbucket).

** Bitbucket
The main access point for Bitbucket was this URL
#+BEGIN_SRC
https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories
#+END_SRC
which produces a paginated list of repositories according the value of the ~pagelen~ parameter. The first URL used to access the API is 
#+BEGIN_SRC
https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories?pagelen=100
#+END_SRC
which grabs the maximum number of entries.

Each entryâ€™s full spec can be viewed [[https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/repositories-endpoint-423626330.html][here]] on the Bitbucket API documentation website. For brevity, these are only the relevant entries for an example of the data returned on a repository from this query:
