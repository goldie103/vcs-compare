* Data
The data used was the public repositories on [[http://github.com][Github]] and [[http://bitbucket.org][Bitbucket]], and was obtained by querying their respective APIs.

Both APIs produced a JSON-formatted result, which in some cases directly included the required data, or included a link to another API query which held related data. In some form or another, both had access to all of the following:
    - Name
    - Description
    - Owner
    - Size
    - Language
    - Branches
    - Commits
    - Issues
    - Forks
    - Subscribers

Of this, only these were used and saved into the database:
    - Name
    - Description
    - Size
    - Number of forks
    - Primary language

As well as an added ~host~ key for which host the data came from (i.e. ~GH~ for Github or ~BB~ for Bitbucket).

** Bitbucket
The main access point for Bitbucket was this URL
#+BEGIN_SRC
https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories
#+END_SRC
which produces a paginated list of repositories according the value of the ~pagelen~ parameter. The first URL used to access the API is 
#+BEGIN_SRC
https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories?pagelen=100
#+END_SRC
which grabs the maximum number of entries as a paginated response.

Each entryâ€™s full spec can be viewed [[https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/repositories-endpoint-423626330.html][here]] on the Bitbucket API documentation website. For brevity, these are only the relevant entries for an example of the data returned on a repository from this query:
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
{
    "pagelen": 10,
    "next": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=3",
    "values": [{
        "description": "Mercurial (hg) extension to allow commenting on commit messages.  Mainly written for practice reading & working with mercurial internals.\r\n",
        "links": {
            "commits": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/phlogistonjohn/tweakmsg/commits"},
            "forks": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/phlogistonjohn/tweakmsg/forks"},
        },
        "name": "tweakmsg",
        "language": "",
        "created_on": "2008-06-25T00:53:00.273366+00:00",
        "full_name": "phlogistonjohn/tweakmsg",
        "updated_on": "2012-06-24T17:32:27.458855+00:00",
        "size": 7085,
    },
#+END_SRC
The links for obtaining counts of forks were pulled from these responses. The same could have been done for commits, but due to issues in obtaining commits from the Github API, that data was excluded.

The ~next~ entry contains the link to the next page of repositories, which was used to
